		To add transitions between two states, click first on the starting state.
                Then <i>move</i> the mouse to the end state and click. You always see a preview
                of the resulting transition. After second click a window will appear and you
                can define the transition letters.<br />

                You also have the possibility to autocomplete the transitions,
                e.g. you like to return to a certain state or remain in the
                current state when reading the rest of the alphabet. Click on <b>DFA -
                Autocomplete transitions... </b><br />
